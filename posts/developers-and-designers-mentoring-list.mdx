As a career changer, I have spent a lot of time googling my way through coding resources. If you are also a developer you probably have too. There are loads of articles on how to learn to code, and sites like Hackr and Bento make it easy to find resources based on topics and tools.

    But what about mentoring? If there is one thing I wish I had had at the start of my developer journey, it would have been a mentor. But finding one is actually not an easy task, especially if you come from a different field. That’s why I have compiled a list of free mentorship platforms for developers and designers — to make it easier for others to find one when they need it.

### This is a Markdown subheading

We just used a `###` subheading in our blog post.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
  {`
    const doStuff = () => {
      return console.log('hey')
    }
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

// this is a code block const doSomething = () => { return console.log('hey') }
